      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I want to track the time that I drink water and how much water I drink in certain time. So in my assignment, I divide the time by hour and record the water intake amount in every time unit. 

        In the assignment, the rain drops represent the process that I drink, and the rising water level represents the total water intake amount in a day. When I drink more, the rain drops fall faster, and the water below rises quicker. When clicking the slider, the amount of water I drink in every hour from 9AM to 10PM reveals.

        Through the process, I found that I would drink more water during the class, and less at the early morning and the evening. This makes me reflect on how I should be more proactive about consuming more water in general, rather than drinking it when I'm bored or have nothing else to do.</p>
