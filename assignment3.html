      <h1>Assignment 3 Experimental Clock</h1>
    </header>
    <main id="assignment-page">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Write a description for your experimental clock. How is it novel to you and how might it alter the way you track / keep time?</h3>
      <p>I created 3 different colors of circles to represent the hour pointer, minute pointer and the second pointer, the position of each circle corresponds to the position of the three hands on an ordinary clock. At the center of my clock, I made a turntable pattern. This turntable is changeable according to the second and the minute parameters. As the minute parameter gets closer to 60, the color of the pattern gets lighter, and as the second parameter gets closer to 60, there are more sectors in the turntable pattern, and the number of darker sectors is the same as the current second number.</p>
      <p>What's novel to me is that it not only tells time, but creates a pattern in every second. Also, it's a clock that tells time without any pointer, which makes it neat.</p>
      <h3>Describe your design process. Include all three of your design sketches and explain how you’ve ended up choosing one.</h3>
      <p>I want to create something that can change with the time, and people can know that time as soon as they see that pattern. When I think of this, I think I can relate the pattern to some math pattern, so I started to think of some math patterns. After brainstorming, I came up with the pie chart and the donut chart. At first, I think it would be cool to make the sectors of pie chart change according to the second parameter, and make another concentric circles pattern on top of the pie chart and make it change according to the minute parameter. I tried it, but I found that making two kinds of changes is too hard for me, so at the end I only made the pie chart pattern. However, I still want the pattern to show the changes of minute parameter, so I let the minute parameter to decide the color of it. Now I still need one way to tell the hour. But I thought for a long time and couldn't think of what can be changed on the pattern, so at the end I decided to just add a red circle to represent the hour pointer on a clock to tell time.</p>
      <h3>What’s your overall reflection on this assignment? What have you learned throughout the process of designing an unconventional clock?</h3>
      <p>After designing the clock, I discover that to make an unconventional clock, you need to whether find a special way to track time, or create a funny way to tell and show time. In my project, I chose the second way to make a unusual clock. Although it is simple and can be improved in many ways, I think it is a special clock.</p>
