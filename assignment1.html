      <h1>Assignment 1 Lost & Found</h1>

    <main>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>The language your partner used to describe the image</h3>
      <p>"It was a cowboy hat that was blackish brown and had a star on it. It had a large brim that went upwards."</p>
      <h3>Your interpretation of the image</h3>
      <p>I think it would be quiet similar to the hat that Hudi in toy story wears, but with a larger brim. Besides, I think its color would be darker.</p> 
      <h3>The depiction of the image using code</h3>
      <p>I used two rotated ellipse and a rectangle to draw the large brim, after that I used a trapezoid and an ellipse to draw the rest part of the hat. 
        To make it look more three-dimensional, I used a lighter color to draw the structure inside the hat. When I finished drawing the body of the hat, 
        I started to draw stars. After I drew all the elements in my partner's description, I found that that there's a lot space in the image, so I started
         to add a smiling face and a background of desert to match the style of the hat.</p>
      <h3>The differences in interpretation at all stages of the assignment</h3>
      <p>After I finish the hat, I want to draw a line between the brim and the body of the hat to make the two parts distinguished. But I found that I can't
         draw a line in a specific position, so I quit. After I show the drawing to my partner, she said that the color should be more blackish, so later I made
          the color darker.</p>
