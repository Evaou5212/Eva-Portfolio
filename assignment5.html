      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Describe the process of researching, designing, and fine-tuning your optical illusion.</h3>
      <p>I searched "optical illusion gif" on pinterest to find some examples, and eventually I found this flutuating pattern that I really like. At first I wanted to mimic this pattern to make several fluctuating line, but the final effect doesn't look like what I think it should be and I don't know how to make it moves smoothly as the gif show, so it ended up the way it is now. However I found that it generated an optical illusion that I did't expected! The line in the middle looks like it is far from us, and the top and buttom of the lines look closer. That's a surprising effect.</p>
      <h3>How might your optical illusion get deployed in the world around you? May it be incorporated into a browser extension? Can it possibly be turned into a piece of wearable?</h3>
      <p>I think it would be cool if it is wearable. Stripes are never old-fashioned. If we use some lenticular technology to make it changeable, it would be eye-catching.</p>
