      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Your design process. Include your design sketches</h3>
      <p>When I was practicing random changes in color, I suddenly thought of trying to change the grayscale. So in my attempt, I further thought that I could apply the grayscale changes to human hair, and use color to represent the human hair change from youth to old age. Then I thought of the most famous old man in the world - Santa Claus!
        I started to draw a sketch of it, and when I was drawing, I also began to think, in addition to using variables to control the changes in hair color, which part of the face can be controlled to make the entire painting more interesting? Then it came up to me that I could control the eyes to follow the movement of the mouse, and the size of the eyes would change as the mouse moved, and the grin of the mouth would also change with the mouse, so that the whole face could show more diverse expressions.I also designed some changes when pressing the mouse. As the mouse pressed, the color of the hat and clothes of the Santa Claus would change randomly, and I also change the background color to black and make some flashing lanterns on top so that it seems like some decoratioins in Christmas.
      <h3>What have you discovered about the form you've chosen through this assignment?</h3>
      <p>I found it a lot more interestinga and vivid when you can interact with the painting. Actually when I'm coding for the flashing lights when mouse pressed, originally I was thinking to make each light colored in different random color, but then I found that I didn't know how to do it, instead, I can only make either all lights in one random color or all lights flashing like it is now. But I think that is fine too, although I still have no idea how to realize my first thought.</p>
