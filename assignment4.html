      <h1>Assignment 4 Exquisite Corpse</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>My partnersâ€™ names</h3>
       <p>Shiqi and Noelani</p> 
       <h3>My design process</h3>
       <p>I wanted to create an image of a teddy bear that was completely different from the stereotypical one. In the conventional image, a teddy bear is a warm, gentle character that lies in your bed and accompanies you to sleep. But I wanted to flip this image on its head, I wanted the teddy bear to show an evil and critical side, and to have an inner mind that we don't know about, so I spliced the body of the main character of the cartoon series Daria into his body to reflect this characteristic. Besides, normally we think that the teddy bear is living on land, but I think maybe the bear wants to siwm in the ocean but lack of the swimming ability. So I added a mermaid tail to it so that it can swim in the ocean.</p>
       <h3>A new background story I'm creating based on the collectively assembled information</h3>
       <p>Based on the new image, I think it is a spunky rabbit who exchanged pacts with a witch for a human body. But the witch he found was not very magical, so there was a mistake in adding hands and feet to him, resulting in him only having a strange paw and not very long baby legs. But he is still happy to get those hands and legs, so after that he happily buy himself a drink and dancing on the way home.</p>
       <h3>Assignment Reflection</h3>
       <p>In this assignment, I used the bezier curve for the first time, and it was really a challenge to me to draw so many curves without knowing the x & y value of each point. During the process, to better draw a bezier curve, I tried to find a tool to help me draw a bezier curve in advance and get the position of the points. Although it still took me a lot of time deawing the curves, the effect is good. </p>
